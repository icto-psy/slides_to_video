# Slides_to_video

This script transforms the slides of a [Mediasite](http://www.sonicfoundry.com/mediasite/) export to a continuous mp4 of the same length as the original lecture recording.
The resulting video is easier to use for later processing in editing software. 

## Getting started

To run this script, you will need to install ffmpeg on the local machine. 
A good how to for different operating systems can be found here: https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg
